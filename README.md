### Hello!
I'm @jrmmendes (he/him). You can call me Mendes or Romildo! I'm currently using TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL, NodeJS and deploying my applications to Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean and AWS. 

I love sharing skills, creating educational content and writing, then if you have something that I can help, get in touch with me!

### Things to know about me (for coworkers)
- ðŸ“Ÿ I love async/text based communication. You can message me any time - although maybe I'll reply latter;
- ðŸ‘‹ Use the "no hello" policy: [Please Don't Say Just Hello In Chat](https://www.nohello.com/);
- ðŸ“… If you want me for some synchronous activity (e.g. google meet), send-me an invitation (on Google Calendar, Teams, etc);
